## TODO:

**Enemies:**
 - Enemies have alerted state and non-alerted state
 - Enemies get alerted when player enters their cone of vision and is in a restricted area or enters the vault
 - The enemy that spots the player tries to shoot the player immediatly
 - Reaction time is different according to their state (Allerting, aiming and shooting)
 - 2 types of enemies: patrolling and guards
 - Guards stand still on the guns blazing path
 - Patrolling enemies patrol the restricted areas of the stealth path
 - When alerted the guards turn towards the vault and the patrolling enemies try to find the player

**Player:**
 - Limited actions on time stop
 - Slow everything on time slow, even player movement
 - Dash with recharge time
 - Delay between shots, dash resets this delay
 - Dash and time power balance

**Level Design:**
 - Guns Blazing path and stealth path
 - Balance between both paths: guns blazing is shorter but harder, stealth is longer and more strategic
 - Limited vision on alarm (experimental)
 - Level 2
